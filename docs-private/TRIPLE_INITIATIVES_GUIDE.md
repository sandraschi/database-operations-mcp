## üìã Improvement Plan for database-operations-mcp

### ‚úÖ TIER 1 - Batch Work (Already Done or In Progress)

**These improvements can be done WITHOUT opening this repo in Cursor:**

- [x] docs-private/ folder created
- [x] .gitignore updated
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created (if missing)
- [x] Dependabot disabled (if present)
- [ ] ci.yml template applied (if simple)
- [ ] Standard .gitignore additions

**Status:** Mostly complete (Day 1)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TIER 2 - Deep Work (REQUIRES Opening This Repo)

**These improvements NEED full context - must open this repo in Cursor:**

- [ ] Reduce workflows from 9 to 2-3
- [ ] Fix ruff errors
- [ ] Fix pytest failures
- [ ] Create release v1.0.0b1

**Why full context needed:**
- Need <project_layout> tag to see full structure
- Need to understand import relationships
- Need real-time linter/type checker feedback
- Need to trace through code for complex fixes
- Need comprehensive understanding before refactoring

**Status:** Waiting for dedicated Cursor instance

---

## üöÄ How To Work on This Repo

### Option 1: Quick Batch Improvements (Any Time)

**From any Cursor workspace:**
```powershell
cd D:\Dev\repos\database-operations-mcp
# Run simple operations
# Commit changes
```

**Suitable for:**
- Simple file updates
- Template application
- Mechanical operations

---

### Option 2: Deep Improvements (RECOMMENDED)

**Open this repo in its own Cursor instance:**

1. **File ‚Üí Open Folder** ‚Üí `D:\Dev\repos\database-operations-mcp`
2. Wait for project layout to load
3. Execute ALL THREE initiatives in one session:
   - **Doc Bash:** Upgrade docs, fix issues
   - **GitHub Dash:** Modernize CI/CD
   - **Release Flash:** Fix errors, test, release
4. Test thoroughly (ruff, pytest, workflows)
5. Commit all changes
6. Create release tag if ready
7. Close folder

**Time estimate:** 2-4 hours for complete improvement

---

## üéØ CRITICAL Priority Actions

- Reduce workflow spam
- First release

---

## üìù Notes

**Cursor Instance Management:**
- You can have ~5 Cursor instances open simultaneously üòÑ
- Recommend: 1-2 for deep work, keep one for batch operations
- Close instances when done to free resources

**Session Strategy:**
- Morning: Batch work across repos (stay in current workspace)
- Afternoon: Deep work on 1-2 priority repos (open dedicated instances)
- Evening: Track progress, plan next session

**Tracking:**
- All progress tracked in: `D:\Dev\repos\mcp-central-docs`
- Advanced Memory notes for each initiative
- Per-repo STATUS.md files in central docs
