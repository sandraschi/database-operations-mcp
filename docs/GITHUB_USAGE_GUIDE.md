## 🌿 Branching Strategy

### Main Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

### Supporting Branches
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

## 🔄 Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes & Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new database connection handler"
   ```

3. **Push & Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create PR via GitHub UI
   ```

## 🚀 Release Management

### Creating a Release
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create release notes
3. Create and push tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

### Automated Release Process
- Tags matching `v*` trigger the release workflow
- Builds and publishes to PyPI
- Creates GitHub release with artifacts
- Updates changelog

## 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Triggers
- Push to `main`/`develop`: Run tests and linting
- Push tags (`v*.*.*`): Create release
- Manual dispatch: Available for specific jobs

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Test** - Unit and integration tests
2. **Lint** - Code style and type checking
3. **Build** - Create packages
4. **Publish** - Deploy to PyPI/TestPyPI
5. **Release** - Create GitHub release
